# Archive — Non-Canonical or Transitional Material

This domain contains documents that are:

- Superseded by later versions
- Transitional drafts
- Structurally incomplete
- Experimental or exploratory
- Preserved for record continuity

Inclusion here does not imply invalidity.

It indicates that the document is not part of the current canonical structural surface.

Historical continuity is preserved for version tracking and structural evolution analysis.

Archive material must not be cited as representing the active canonical position unless explicitly reactivated.

No architectural invariant is defined in this domain.

It exists to preserve traceability, not authority.
