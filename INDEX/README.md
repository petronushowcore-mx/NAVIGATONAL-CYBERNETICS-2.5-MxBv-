# PETRONUS — Core Architecture Index

This repository contains the consolidated architectural corpus of the PETRONUS framework and Cybernetics 2.5 class of systems.

The structure is intentionally minimal. This index does not explain the theory, interpret its structure, or provide guided navigation. It serves as a stable anchor and versioned registry of documents.

The corpus is divided into three structural domains:

- Ontology (structural primitives)
- Philosophy (ontological justification and interpretive layer)
- Architecture (formal and operational layers)

This repository is not a tutorial and not a design manual.

No document here should be read as a prescriptive implementation guide unless explicitly marked as such.

Canonical documents are versioned and preserved. Later reinterpretations do not invalidate earlier releases.

This index provides location, not interpretation.

For canonical invariants refer to the Ontology layer.
For formal structural closure refer to the Architecture layer.
