# Architecture — Formal and Operational Layers

This domain contains formal specifications, architectural operators, admissibility mechanisms, and structural control layers.

It includes but is not limited to:

- Admissibility-first architectures
- Regime-level control and viability gating
- Structural drift accumulation models
- Identity continuity constraints
- Internal time formalization
- Phase transition cost and structural load
- Alignment and interaction field constructs
- Temporal Structural Controller (TSC)
- ΔE-inspired dissipative regulators
- D3A stack and related modules

Architecture does not override ontology.

All operators are subordinate to admissibility ordering and non-causal structural constraints.

No admissibility predicate is permitted to collapse into optimization.

This layer defines how structural invariants are preserved without converting them into reward signals or penalties.

It is not a product specification.

It is an architectural constraint surface.
