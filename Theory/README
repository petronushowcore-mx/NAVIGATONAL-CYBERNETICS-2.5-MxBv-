# Theory — Axiomatic and Structural Closure Layer

This domain contains the formal theoretical consolidation of Navigational Cybernetics 2.5.

While Ontology defines structural primitives, and Architecture develops operational mechanisms, the Theory layer establishes formal closure through axioms, structural invariants, and derived theorems.

The document contained here does not introduce a product, implementation, or applied system.

It defines the structural class through formal articulation.

Specifically, this layer:

- Fixes drift as the primary medium of adaptive existence.
- Formalizes directionality as a structural operator.
- Establishes admissibility as prior to optimization.
- Defines coherence and regime constraints as architectural invariants.
- Articulates the limits of equilibrium-centric frameworks.
- Introduces the axiomatic boundary of long-horizon adaptive systems.

The Theory layer functions as structural consolidation.

It does not prescribe implementation details.
It does not expose algorithmic realization.
It does not provide optimization procedures.

It defines what must be true for a system to belong to the architectural class.

Any compatible architecture must satisfy the invariants articulated here, regardless of implementation strategy.

Drift is primary. Equilibrium is derivative.
