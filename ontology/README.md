# Ontology — Structural Primitives

This domain contains the ontological foundations of the PETRONUS framework.

Ontology defines what exists structurally before any notion of optimization, policy, reward, control, or representation.

The primitives contained here are not derived from engineering convenience or empirical performance.

They are introduced as architectural necessities for long-horizon adaptive survival.

Key primitives include:

- Directionality (Will) as admissible orientation of continuation
- Drift as inevitable structural medium
- Spin as carrier of directional asymmetry
- Coherence as condition of existence
- Inertia as default regime
- Contact-centric evolution as non-action ontology

These primitives are not implementation artifacts.

They define the class boundary of Cybernetics 2.5 systems.

Any system violating these primitives is classified outside this architectural class.
