# NAVIGATONAL CYBERNETICS 2.5 (MxBv) — Core Corpus

This repository contains the canonical structural corpus defining the architectural class referred to as Cybernetics of Order 2.5.

The material collected here establishes ontological primitives, structural axioms, admissibility constraints, and long-horizon viability theorems governing adaptive systems operating under irreversible drift.

This repository does not describe a product, implementation, or proprietary system.

It defines a structural architectural class.

## Architectural Position

The framework is built on the following non-negotiable principles:

- Drift is a navigable structural medium, not an error.
- Admissibility is structurally prior to action, optimization, and control.
- Long-horizon viability cannot be reduced to reward or performance metrics.
- Identity continuity is a structural property independent of local correctness.
- Admissibility-relevant structure must not become causally actionable.

Systems violating these constraints are classified outside the Cybernetics 2.5 architectural class.

## Repository Structure

- `01_ONTOLOGY` — Structural primitives defining the architectural class.
- `02_PHILOSOPHY` — Ontological and justificatory texts.
- `03_ARCHITECTURE` — Formal axioms, theorems, admissibility mechanisms, regime operators, internal-time constraints.
- `90_ARCHIVE` — Transitional or non-canonical material.

## Relationship to Implementations

Concrete architectures (including PETRONUS™ and others) may claim compatibility with this framework.

No implementation is derived or prescribed here.

Multiple non-equivalent realizations may satisfy the same structural constraints.
