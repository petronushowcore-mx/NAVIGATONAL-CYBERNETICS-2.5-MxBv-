# Navigational Cybernetics 2.5 — Core Corpus

This repository contains the canonical structural corpus defining the architectural class referred to as Cybernetics of Order 2.5.

The materials collected here establish ontological primitives, structural axioms, admissibility constraints, and long-horizon viability conditions for adaptive systems operating under irreversible drift.

This repository does not describe a product, implementation, or engineering manual.

It defines an architectural classification framework.

---

## Architectural Scope

The framework concerns adaptive systems that:

- operate under non-zero structural drift,
- accumulate irreversible internal history,
- admit regime-level transitions with long-horizon consequences,
- require authorization of irreversible commitments.

Systems that treat admissibility as a soft constraint, penalty, reward term, or optimization objective are classified outside this architectural class.

---

## Structural Position

Within this framework:

- Drift is not an error term.
- Admissibility is structurally prior to action selection.
- Long-horizon viability is not reducible to local performance.
- Identity continuity cannot be inferred from correctness.
- Admissibility-relevant structure must not become causally actionable.

These are class-defining constraints, not design preferences.

## Repository Domains

- `INDEX` — Canonical registry of documents and structural mapping.
- `ONTOLOGY` — Structural primitives defining the architectural class (drift, directionality, admissibility, coherence, regime).
- `PHILOSOPHY` — Interpretive and justificatory texts articulating ontological consequences and experiential implications.
- `THEORY` — Formal axioms, structural theorems, class boundaries, and non-reducibility results.
- `ARCHITECTURE` — Operational mechanisms, admissibility operators, regime regulators, structural controllers, and implementation-neutral system layers.
- `ARCHIVE` — Transitional, superseded, or non-canonical material preserved for traceability.

---

## Implementation Neutrality

Concrete systems may claim compatibility with this framework.

No specific implementation is prescribed here.

Multiple non-equivalent architectures may satisfy the same structural constraints.
