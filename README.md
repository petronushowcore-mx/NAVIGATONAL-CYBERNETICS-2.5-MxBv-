# Navigational Cybernetics 2.5 — Core Corpus

This repository contains the canonical structural corpus defining the architectural class referred to as Cybernetics of Order 2.5.

The materials collected here establish ontological primitives, structural axioms, admissibility constraints, and long-horizon viability conditions for adaptive systems operating under irreversible drift.

This repository does not describe a product, implementation, or engineering manual.

It defines an architectural classification framework.

---

## Architectural Scope

The framework concerns adaptive systems that:

- operate under non-zero structural drift,
- accumulate irreversible internal history,
- admit regime-level transitions with long-horizon consequences,
- require authorization of irreversible commitments.

Systems that treat admissibility as a soft constraint, penalty, reward term, or optimization objective are classified outside this architectural class.

## Structural Position

Within this framework:

- Drift is not an error term.
- Admissibility is structurally prior to action selection.
- Long-horizon viability is not reducible to local performance.
- Identity continuity cannot be inferred from correctness.
- Admissibility-relevant structure must not become causally actionable.

These are class-defining constraints, not design preferences.

## Repository Domains

- `ONTOLOGY` — Structural primitives and class boundaries.
- `PHILOSOPHY VIEW` — Ontological justification and interpretive texts.
- `ARCHITECTURE` — Formal axioms, theorems, admissibility mechanisms, and structural operators.
- `ARCHIVE` — Transitional or non-canonical material.

---

## Implementation Neutrality

Concrete systems may claim compatibility with this framework.

No specific implementation is prescribed here.

Multiple non-equivalent architectures may satisfy the same structural constraints.
