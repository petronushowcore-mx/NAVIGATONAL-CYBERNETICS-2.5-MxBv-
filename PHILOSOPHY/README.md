# Philosophy — Ontological Justification Layer

This domain contains interpretive and justificatory texts underlying the architectural framework.

Philosophy here does not function as commentary.

It provides the structural argument for why long-horizon systems collapse under optimization-centric paradigms.

This layer addresses:

- The illusion of choice
- The structural necessity of directionality
- Identity under temporal pressure
- Survival as a non-optimizing constraint
- Meaning as consequence structure
- Chaos as loss of semantic continuity

These texts are not empirical models and not speculative essays.

They articulate boundary conditions that later become formalized within the Architecture domain.

Philosophy does not add mechanisms.

It clarifies why mechanisms must exist.
