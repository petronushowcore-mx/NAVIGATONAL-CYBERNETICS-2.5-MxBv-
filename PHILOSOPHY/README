# PHILOSOPHY — Ontological Interpretation Layer

This domain contains the philosophical articulation of Navigational Cybernetics 2.5.

It does not introduce new primitives, formal axioms, or implementation mechanisms.

Instead, it clarifies the ontological consequences of the framework and explores how structural constraints manifest in lived experience, identity, decision, and temporal perception.

The texts collected here operate at the level of interpretation rather than construction.

They examine:

- The illusion of choice under constrained admissibility
- Identity as a regime-dependent stabilization
- Will as a residual mode rather than an origin
- Irreversibility as structural contraction of future space
- Phase closure and accumulated structural debt
- Non-finality as the condition of persistence
- Consciousness as interface rather than container
- Ethical responsibility as transmission fidelity

This layer does not prescribe behavior and does not function as normative ethics.

It does not provide algorithms or regulatory mechanisms.

It articulates how structural ontology appears when translated into phenomenological and existential language.

The philosophical domain is interpretive, not generative.

Its purpose is not to expand the architecture, but to prevent misinterpretation of its implications.
